My name is [Ahmad Syed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-syed/) and I'm a data science novice with a bachelor's degree in business analytics from San Jose State University. <strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> have already changed the world so much and i believe we are just getting started.
